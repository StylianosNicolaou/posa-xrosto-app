POSA XROSTO - Smart Bill Splitter
==================================

"The art of splitting bills without breaking friendships."

Posa Xrosto (Πόσα Χρωστώ;) is Greek for "How much do I owe?" — and that's exactly what this app answers.


THE PROBLEM
-----------

You're at a restaurant with friends. Someone orders an expensive steak, another person just had a salad, and everyone shared the appetizers. Splitting the bill equally doesn't seem fair, but manually calculating each person's share is a nightmare.


THE SOLUTION
------------

Posa Xrosto calculates what each person actually owes based on which items they shared — not just an equal split of the total.

Simply:
1. Add all the items from your bill
2. Select who shared each item
3. Get an instant, fair breakdown of what everyone owes


FEATURES
--------

Smart Per-Item Splitting
Assign each dish to the specific people who shared it. The app automatically calculates individual shares based on actual consumption.

Receipt Scanning
Take a photo of your receipt and the app automatically extracts all items and prices. No manual typing required.

Flexible Groups
Works for groups of 2 to 20 people. Add everyone's names and easily assign them to items.

Real-Time Totals
See running totals update instantly as you add items and assign participants.

Share Results
Export and share the final breakdown with your group. Choose between a simple summary (just totals) or a full detailed breakdown showing each person's items.

Works Offline
Install the app on your phone and use it even without internet. Perfect for restaurants with poor signal.

Mobile-First Design
Built specifically for use at restaurants — large buttons, easy gestures, and a clean interface that works great on phones.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

Step 1: Enter Group Size
Tell the app how many people are splitting the bill (2-20 people).

Step 2: Add Names
Enter everyone's name so you can easily identify who shared what.

Step 3: Add Items
Either scan your receipt with the camera or manually add each item. For each item, tap the names of everyone who shared it.

Step 4: See Results
The app calculates exactly what each person owes. You'll see:
- The total bill amount
- Each person's share
- A breakdown of which items they're paying for


EXAMPLE
-------

Pizza ($20) shared by Alice, Bob, and Carol
→ Each pays $6.67

Steak ($40) only Bob
→ Bob pays $40

Appetizer ($15) shared by everyone
→ Each pays $5

FINAL TOTALS:
- Alice: $11.67 (pizza share + appetizer share)
- Bob: $51.67 (pizza share + steak + appetizer share)
- Carol: $11.67 (pizza share + appetizer share)


RECEIPT SCANNING TIPS
---------------------

For best results when scanning receipts:
- Good lighting — avoid shadows and glare
- Hold steady while capturing
- Include the entire receipt in frame
- Lay the receipt flat if possible

If camera doesn't work, you can also upload a photo from your gallery.
